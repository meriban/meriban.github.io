`conciliator` is a **software package** created by Jeff Chiu that allows entity **reconciliation** with **VIAF**, **ORCID**, Open Library and Apache Solr collections out of the box.

Other than OpenRefine's built in Wikidata reconciliation service, `conciliator` does not allow you to pull in additional data after successfully reconciling. It's probably possible to pull in full records via "Add column by fetching URLs..." tough. Not played around with this yet.
{: .notice--warning}

[https://github.com/codeforkjeff/conciliator](https://github.com/codeforkjeff/conciliator)

> `conciliator` is a collection of OpenRefine reconciliation services, as well as a Java framework for creating them.

It is possible to use the implementation on Jeff Chiu's public server ([https://refine.codefork.com/](https://refine.codefork.com/)) for small scale reconciliations, but **for larger projects one is asked not to tax this server and run one's own** (see [below](#run-own-instance-in-docker-in-windows) for instructions on doing this in a Windows environment).

# Using `conciliator` in OpenRefine

Please do **not** use the public server for large projects, but [run your own locally](#run-own-instance-in-docker-on-windows)! 
{: .notice--danger}

If you use your own instance **make sure your Docker container is running** throughout the reconciliation process.

## Match sensitivity

The matching against VIAF is very **sensitive** to differences in **punctuation** or heading. E.g. attempting to match "*Trotnow, Helmut.*" will not get a perfect match as the "." is not part of the headings matched against. 

Presence or absence of **dates** can skew results a lot. E.g. "*Trotnow, Helmut*" scores only 0.577 against "*Trotnow, Helmut, 1946-*". The absence of the date in the search term leads to a significant difference given how short the term is. The same will be true for **titles**, **fuller form of name** etc. Any $e (relator term) should definitely be removed before reconciliation.

**Diacritics** and **special characters** are likely also problematic. 

## Match modes

There are three ways to interact with the VIAF data via `conciliator`:

### Reconcile against names from any VIAF source

| Docker image URL                       | Public server URL                            |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `http://localhost:8080/reconcile/viaf` | `https://refine.codefork.com/reconcile/viaf` |

This is useful if you are not too sure that your search terms/headings match a specific source's headings. E.g. dates can be problematic as "*Trotnow, Helmut*" will not match with "*Trotnow, Helmut, 1946-*". Some contributing sources use "*Trotnow, Helmut*" as the heading though, so one would still get a match to the cluster.

### Reconcile against a specific VIAF source[^5]

| Docker image URL                                             | Public server URL                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `http://localhost:8080/reconcile/viaf/`**`{source ID}`**     | `https://refine.codefork.com/reconcile/viaf/`**`{source ID}`** |
| `http://localhost:8080/reconcile/viaf/`**`LC`** searches records contributed by the Library of Congress only | `https://refine.codefork.com/reconcile/viaf/`**`LC`** searches records contributed by the Library of Congress only |

As per above you'll want to be pretty sure about your search terms matching source headings to do this. Searching LC records with "*Trotnow, Helmut*" will not result in an outright, high confidence match as the LC heading is "*Trotnow, Helmut, 1946-*". The match found is of rather low confidence at 0.577. 

### Reconcile against a **specific VIAF source**[^5] and **retrieve the source IDs** rather than VIAF cluster IDs

| Docker image URL                                             | Public server URL                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `http://localhost:8080/reconcile/`**`viafproxy/{source ID}`** | `https://refine.codefork.com/reconcile/`**`viafproxy/{source ID}`** |
| `http://localhost:8080/reconcile/`**`viafproxy/{LC}`** searches records contributed by the Library of Congress and retrieves their LCCNs | `https://refine.codefork.com/reconcile/`**`viafproxy/{LC}`** searches records contributed by the Library of Congress and retrieves their LCCNs |

Same caveats as above. 

## First time use (register reconciliation service)

Once you figured out which mode you want to use, and if applicable which source ID[^5], you're ready to add it to the reconciliation services. Each combination of mode and source ID will need its own entry in the reconciliation services list.

Open your OpenRefine project and select "**Reconcile**" → "**Start reconciling...**" in the column of values you want to reconcile again VIAF.

Click "**Add standard service**" and enter the **URL** your choice of mode and ID requires. Click "**Add service**".

## Reuse

Once registered you can simply select the respective service from the list. **If using you own server, which you should do for any job over a couple of records, make sure your Docker container is running!**

# Run own instance in Docker on Windows

## Prerequisites

A machine you have admin access on.

## Install Docker Desktop and WSL

Docker allows you to run programmes in so-called containers that are isolated from each other and your operating system (operating system level virtualisation). The advantage of this is that the state of your operating system (your environment) doesn't matter for the running of the programme; everything it needs is in the container and separate from your operating system. The core software that run and manages the containers is called the Docker Engine.
{: .notice--info}

**Download** the Docker installer from [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/) and **install**. Your machine will require a restart after the installation.

Docker needs a Linux environment to run. This is where WSL (**Windows Subsystem for Linux**) comes in. 

WSL is a Microsoft Windows component that allows the use of a Linux environment from within Windows. If you're running Windows 11 it'll already be installed.
{: .notice--info}

When **opening Docker** Desktop it'll **prompt** you to install **WSL** if it's not there already, or to upgrade it if needed and tell you the respective commands to do so. To run them open e.g. a Command Line instance, paste the provided command in and press 'Enter'.

Once installed you might see a new symbol, representing the Linux environment Docker is running on, in your File Explorer: ![File Explorer symbol showing Docker installation](/assets/images/explorer_docker.png).

You also need to get a **Docker account**. You can e.g. use an existing Google account for that or create one with Docker.

## Install Git and clone the conciliator repository

If you already have Git installed skip the Git installation. 

### Install Git

<div class="notice--info">
Git the most popular version control system. It tracks changes to files and who made the change(s). It is a distributed version control system, which means that there is a central copy, but also a full copy on each contributors' machine, and contributors "pull" changes from the version on the server and "push" changes from their copy to the server one.[^1
] 
It can be used purely as a command line tool, or with a graphical user interface (there are loads of those).
</div>

**Download** the latest release for your system from [https://git-scm.com/install/windows](https://git-scm.com/install/windows) and **install** it. Feel free to also get a GUI to use it with: [https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis?os=windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis?os=windows). The following will be either command line or based on GitHub Desktop.

Now you need to do a bit of [setup for Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup). At the very least you'll want to **configure** your **username** and **email address**. If you're using a GUI it might guide you through this when you first start it up.

```
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

Some more Git vocabulary needed:

- **repository**: a folder within which Git was instructed to keep track of changes
- **clone**: making a copy of a server/remote repository on your computer
- **pull**: getting the latest changes from a server/remote repository

### Clone the conciliator repository

<div class="notice--warning" markdown="1">

When cloning a repository Git by default changes line endings[^2] to the ones native to your operating system. Usually that is a good thing. However, in this particular case that will be problematic, we need Linux line endings for the code to run in Docker. To get Git to change that behaviour run the following in the command line:

```cmd
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

You can revert it back to its default behaviour later if you want:

```cmd
git config --global core.autocrlf true
```
</div>

To clone the conciliator repository from GitHub, you can use the command line or a GUI tool (GitHub Desktop in the images below).

1.  **Using the command line**

    Open a command line and navigate[^3] to the folder you want the repository to live. Then run the following command:

    ```cmd
    git clone https://github.com/codeforkjeff/conciliator
    ```

2. **Using GitHub Desktop**

   Go to [https://github.com/codeforkjeff/conciliator](https://github.com/codeforkjeff/conciliator). 

   Click on "Code" and then "Open with GitHub Desktop". Allow GitHub Desktop to be opened and select a place on your machine for the repository.

   ![illustrates cloning via GitHub using GitHub desktop](/assets/images/clone_github_desktop.png)


## Build a Docker image

The next step is to **build** the code in the cloned repository into a Docker **image**, which in turn can then be run in a container. 

Make sure the **Docker Engine is running** (i.e. Docker Desktop is open).

Open the command line and navigate to the folder containing the cloned repository[^3]. 

Run the following command to build the image:

```cmd
docker build -t conciliator .
```

<div class="notice--danger" markdown="1">

Make sure you **don't forget the dot at the end** of the command, it matters!
</div>

You'll see a lot of text running by in the command line, let it do its thing. This might take a couple of minutes. Once it's finished, you'll have an entry called "conciliator" in Docker Desktop "**Builds**":

![a screenshot of Docker Desktop showing available builds](/assets/images/conciliator_docker_builds.png)

Given the build worked fine, there is now also an entry in "**Images**" called "conciliator":

![a screenshot of Docker Desktop showing available images](/assets/images/conciliator_docker_images.png)

## Run the Docker image in a container

Press the "**Run**" button (▷) in the "Actions" column of the "conciliator" image line. A new window pops up. 

Expand the "Optional settings" and enter:

- a **container name** (or you can leave that blank and Docker will come up with something random and potentially funny 😋)
- **8080** in the first host port line

Click "**Run**".

![a screenshot of the optional settings window with container name and port populated](/assets/images/conciliator_docker_container_settings.png)

In the "**Container**" tab you can see if all went well and the container is running. There should be a green dot in front of the name. 

![a screenshot of Docker Desktop showing available containers](/assets/images/conciliator_docker_container_run.png)

If issues were encountered during the start-up of the container you'll be taken straight to the "Logs" tab of the container. 

Clicking on the container name takes you to the container dashboard. 

You can stop the container by clicking on the blue "Stop" symbol (■) in the container list or individual container dashboard. 

After the first run from the image, the **container** stays and can be **reused** by clicking the "Run" symbol (▷) in the "Actions" column of the respective container or the container's dashboard. Do **not** re-run it from the image each time! If you do this you end up with loads of containers. This would only be necessary if something went wrong or the underlying image needs changing, e.g. because of a code update etc.
{: .notice--info}

Your conciliator container **must** **be running in order to use it for reconciliation in OpenRefine**!

[^5]: You can find a source's ID by going to [https://viaf.org/en](https://viaf.org/en) and either hovering over the link and reading the code from the link preview, or clicking on it and then taking it from the URL itself. E.g. the URL for the National Library of Brazil is https://viaf.org/en/contributors?id=BLBNB, hence its source code is BLBNB.
